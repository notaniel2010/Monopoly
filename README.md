Monopoly
========
A slightly rough version of monopoly. The game includes a text only version and a version that has a graphic that sits on top.
I did not make the graphic that sits on top, a class mate did, for the whole class in fact (teacher wanted him to).
As a result and in being new to GitHub at the time of putting the code on here the overlay probably will not work/get put up at all. 

As per all the other projects I have put up so far this was written in java and was the final project of my senior year computer class


I could probably also clean the code up some more but I figure that I will leave all my print statements in for bug fixing since it would make it easier
